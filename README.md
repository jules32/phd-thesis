# phd-thesis

[Humboldt squid in the northern California current system](https://purl.stanford.edu/pb685tk3754) by Julia S. Stewart, 2012. PhD Thesis, Stanford University.

I wrote all my analyses for my PhD thesis in Matlab. Learning to code mostly by myself, they are examples of incredibly poor coding style and organization; and they are trapped all over my personal computer. I'll be migrating and reorganizing scripts here, with the intent that they can be useful once again.
